    <h1>Q.1.What is JSON</h1>
    <h4> JSON, which stands for JavaScript Object Notation, is a lightweight data-interchange <br> format that's easy for humans to read and write and easy for machines <br> to parse and generate. Itâ€™s commonly used to transmit data between a server <br> and a web application as text. JSON is language-independent but is often used with JavaScript.</h4>
